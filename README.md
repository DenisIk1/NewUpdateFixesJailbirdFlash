i fixed some of the terrible changes northwood made in the 13.5 update

- cola has pre 13.5 speeds 
- cola has pre 13.5 health drain 
- scp500 can cure traumatized effect given by 106 - suggested by follow the owl (this isnt part of 13.5 but i did it anyway)

all of these are configurable to be enabled or disabled
