i fixed some of the terrible changes northwood made in the 13.5 update

- cola has pre 13.5 speeds (health drain is unchanged)
- added back the pre 13.5 914 precipes to craft cola (and 1853)
- scp500 can cure traumatized effect given by 106 - suggested by follow the owl (this isnt part of 13.5 but i did it anyway)

all of these are configurable to have enabled or disabled

any issues - Half__ on discord
